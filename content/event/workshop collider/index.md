summary: Forthcoming Workshop on Advanced Methods for Data Collection and Use. More to come!
abstract: 'This workshop will bring together researchers who are helping to push the research frontiers in the collection and use of data using advanced methods in a range of social science fields. The first session focuses on spatial data (including remote sensing and map recognition) and the second session covers various aspects of tabular data (including OCR/HTR and  table recognition). 

I organize this event with the support of the École normale supérieure de Lyon (Collider "junior lab" grant) and the Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict (CERGIC).'
