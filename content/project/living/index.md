title: 'Local Living Standards in South Asia (1870-1930)'
summary: 'This paper studies the Malthusian constraint on local living standards in a large agricultural economy, colonial South Asia. I build subsistence ratios at the district level. A one percent increase in population density implies a one percent decrease in real wages, including two-ways fixed effects and controls. In a colonial setting of ”limited state”, under-investment in agriculture leads to stagnating wages under population pressure. At the same time, local economies are not at the same stage of convergence to the Malthusian steady-state, implying large regional heterogeneity in living standards.'

In absolute terms, Indian industrialization is a phenomenon of global significance, especially after a century of deindustrialization in the EIC era. At the same time, there was no structural change in unemployment in India until the 1970s. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that solves this puzzle: the race between the Lewisian absorption of rural labor by a rising industrial sector and its Malthusian regeneration. I provide the empirical basis for the relevance of the model in the case of late colonial India. The key elements are a Malthusian economy still characterized by scarcity and slowly recovering from subsistence levels, and low levels of labor mobility, albeit directed away from the agricultural sector. In particular, temporary migration of the kind prevalent in India tends to feed a Malthusian population response in the rural areas of emigration, offsetting productivity gains in the modern sector.
