title: 'The Race between Lewis and Malthus: Theory and Evidence from Colonial South Asia'
summary: 'In absolute terms, Indian industrialization is a phenomenon of global significance, especially after a century of deindustrialization in the EIC era. At the same time, there was no structural change in unemployment in India until the 1970s. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that solves this puzzle: the race between the Lewisian absorption of rural labor by a rising industrial sector and its Malthusian regeneration. I provide the empirical basis for the relevance of the model in the case of late colonial India. The key elements are a Malthusian economy still characterized by scarcity and slowly recovering from subsistence levels, and low levels of labor mobility, albeit directed away from the agricultural sector. In particular, temporary migration of the kind prevalent in India tends to feed a Malthusian population response in the rural areas of emigration, offsetting productivity gains in the modern sector.'

In absolute terms, Indian industrialization is a phenomenon of global significance, especially after a century of deindustrialization in the EIC era. At the same time, there was no structural change in unemployment in India until the 1970s. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that solves this puzzle: the race between the Lewisian absorption of rural labor by a rising industrial sector and its Malthusian regeneration. I provide the empirical basis for the relevance of the model in the case of late colonial India. The key elements are a Malthusian economy still characterized by scarcity and slowly recovering from subsistence levels, and low levels of labor mobility, albeit directed away from the agricultural sector. In particular, temporary migration of the kind prevalent in India tends to feed a Malthusian population response in the rural areas of emigration, offsetting productivity gains in the modern sector.
