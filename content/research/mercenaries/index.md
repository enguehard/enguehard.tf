title: Endemic Violence, Civic Capital and the Fiscal-Military Revolution
summary: On the one hand, a high level of military skill among the population is necessary to wage war; on the other hand, an armed and trained population has stronger bargaining power and is less willing to submit to the taxation demanded by the central government. This project establishes theoretical foundations for the trade-off faced by early modern states, and study its implications for the long-run state development process.

**Abstract**

The link between the "Military Revolution" and European exceptionalism is a crucial question: did increased military competition among European states foster the development of the state and, ultimately, a specific path of economic and political development? To answer this question, the literature has focused on state expenditures, especially military expenditures in the early modern period, as a measure of state capacity. However, state capacity cannot be reduced to its financial dimension, but must also include the capacity for military mobilization. In theory, a strong military extraction capacity can compensate for a weak fiscal capacity. While the evolution of fiscal capacity is well known, this project starts with measuring the evolution of military extractive capacity by collecting data on the size of armies and the number of casualties for all recorded battles of the modern era.

I then point out that the two aspects of extractive capacity (both fiscal and military) refer, on the one hand, to the political question of the consent of the people and, on the other hand, to their productive or military specialization. The growth of the state implied by the Military Revolution requires that 1) the population is capable of meeting the productive and military demands of the state, and 2) the state produces the consent of the population to taxation and/or military mobilization - in other words, civic capital. However, producing consent is costly for the state and can be counterproductive. The state faces a classic trade-off: on the one hand, a high level of military skill among the population is necessary to wage war; on the other hand, an armed and trained population has stronger bargaining power and is less willing to submit to the taxation demanded by the central government. This project aims to establish the theoretical foundations for such a trade-off, and study its implications for the long-run state development process.
