# In absolute terms, Indian industrialization is a phenomenon of global significance, especially after a century of deindustrialization in the EIC era. At the same time, there was no structural change in unemployment in India until the 1970s. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that solves this puzzle: the race between the Lewisian absorption of rural labor by a rising industrial sector and its Malthusian regeneration. I provide the empirical basis for the relevance of the model in the case of late colonial India. The key elements are a Malthusian economy still characterized by scarcity and slowly recovering from subsistence levels, and low levels of labor mobility, albeit directed away from the agricultural sector. In particular, temporary migration of the kind prevalent in India tends to feed a Malthusian population response in the rural areas of emigration, offsetting productivity gains in the modern sector.

**Abstract**

Is a delayed fertility transition an obstacle to structural change? This paper explores a mechanism based on differential demographic behavior across sectors. If the fertility transition is less advanced among households in the traditional sector and there are frictions in intersectoral mobility, then the traditional sector has a "demographic advantage" over the modern sector. In particular, if there are spillovers from income in the modern sector to households in the traditional sector, which occurs especially when the rise of the modern sector occurs through temporary migration, then the rise of urban productivity fuels rural demographic growth. The early development process is thus the result of two contradictory forces: the Lewisian absorption of surplus rural labor in productive industries and its Malthusian regeneration. Based on this intuition, this paper develops a novel model of "structural stationarity" that explains the slow pace of structural change observed in a variety of contemporary and historical contexts in countries at an early stage of development. In particular, the model parameters are estimated on a new panel of wage, employment, and demographic data for colonial India.
