# In absolute terms, Indian industrialization is a phenomenon of global significance, especially after a century of deindustrialization in the EIC era. At the same time, there was no structural change in unemployment in India until the 1970s. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that solves this puzzle: the race between the Lewisian absorption of rural labor by a rising industrial sector and its Malthusian regeneration. I provide the empirical basis for the relevance of the model in the case of late colonial India. The key elements are a Malthusian economy still characterized by scarcity and slowly recovering from subsistence levels, and low levels of labor mobility, albeit directed away from the agricultural sector. In particular, temporary migration of the kind prevalent in India tends to feed a Malthusian population response in the rural areas of emigration, offsetting productivity gains in the modern sector.

**Abstract**

This paper examines how the fertility transition affects structural change, focusing on heterogeneity in demographic behavior. With high fertility of households in the traditional sector, inter-sectoral income spillovers and imperfect labor mobility, rising urban productivity fuels rural demographic growth. The early development process is thus the result of two conflicting forces: the Lewisian absorption of surplus rural labor in productive industries and its Malthusian regeneration. I first document how this conflict has led to structural stagnation in several developing contexts, both historical and contemporary. I then combine the Malthusian and Lewisian frameworks in a novel model of endogenous fertility and labor mobility generating structural stagnation. Finally, I estimate the model on a new subdistrict-level demographic dataset for colonial India, providing an empirical assessment of the rural-urban demographic gap.
