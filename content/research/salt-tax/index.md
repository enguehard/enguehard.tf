**Abstract**
 Preliminary and incomplete version: A Historical Geographic Information System of the Grandes Gabelles in Early Modern France.

 This note presents the development of a parish-level historical geographic information system (GIS) for the seventeenth-century French salt tax system of the gabelles based using an original manuscript map collection from 1665: Sanson's \textit{Atlas des gabelles}. In addition, it offers a detailed account of the tax system and provides international comparisons to contextualize its significance.
