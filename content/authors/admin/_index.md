I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Center for Economic Reserch on Governance, Inequality and Conflict (CERGIC) within the École normale supérieure in Lyon, France. My research interests include political economy, growth and economic history.

My surname originates from Normandy, and is related to a patronymic found throughout the Germanic language area (with variants such as Engelhardt or Inglehart). In French, it is pronounced /ɑ̃gø.aʁ/.
