I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Center for Economic Reserch on Governance, Inequality and Conflict ([CERGIC](http://economie.ens-lyon.fr/en/research/cergic)) within the [École normale supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/). My research spans political economy, (macro) development and economic history.

I am interested in various issues related to long-run economic and institutional development, including the political economy of taxation, military recruitment and resistance to the expansion of the state, the interaction between demographic transition and structural change, and historical living standards.
