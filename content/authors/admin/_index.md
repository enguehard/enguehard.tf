I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr) within the [École normale supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/), and a research fellow at the University of Bologna - Alma Mater Studiorum, as part of the ERC [GENPOP](http://genpop.org/). My research spans political economy, (macro) development and economic history.

I am interested in a variety of issues related to long-run economic and institutional development, including the political economy of taxation, military recruitment and resistance to state expansion, the interaction between demographic transition and structural change, and historical living standards.
