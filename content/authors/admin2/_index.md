title: About me


---
While being a civil servant scholar at [École normale supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en), I completed a Master's degree in economics at [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/?lang=en). Before that, I followed a liberal arts curriculum, including a Bachelor degree in philosophy at the [Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/en). Since starting my PhD at [ENS de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) thanks to a government scholarship, I have made short visits to the [Scuola Sant'Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it/en) in Pisa, the [Harris School](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) in Chicago and the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).
        
My surname is pronounced [/ɑ̃gø.aʁ/](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.j.m.enguehard/). Originally from Normandy, it is related to a surname found throughout the Germanic language area (with variants such as Engelhardt or Inglehart) and was probably introduced into northwest France as a result of medieval Norman settlement.
        
[.tf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tf) is the Internet domain for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, which happened to be available.
