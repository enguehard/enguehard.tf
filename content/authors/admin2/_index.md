While being a scholar at [École normale supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en), I completed a Master's degree in economics at [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/?lang=en). Before that, I followed a liberal arts path, including a Bachelor degree in philosophy at the [Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/en). Since starting my PhD at ENS de Lyon with a government scholarship, I have made short visits to the [Scuola Sant'Anna](https://www.santannapisa.it/en) in Pisa, the [Harris School](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) in Chicago and the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).
        
My surname is pronounced [/ɑ̃gø.aʁ/](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/e.j.m.enguehard/). It originates from Normandy, and is related to a patronymic found throughout the Germanic language area (with variants such as Engelhardt or Inglehart).
        
[.tf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.tf) is the Internet domain for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, which happened to be available.
